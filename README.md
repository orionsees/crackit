# CrackIt: A Python Quiz App

This was my first programming project, which I completed in 10th grade. The app, called **CrackIt**, is a Python-based quiz platform that uses the Tkinter library for its graphical user interface (GUI). It allows you to add chapters and questions for different subjects such as physics, chemistry, math, and custom topics. You can take quizzes, track your progress, and view your performance through graphs and statistics. It also integrates the PIL library to handle image processing since questions are presented as images that are saved and later used in quizzes. Libraries such as Pandas and the CSV module are used to store chapter details, test results, and settings. Essentially, it helps you practice and document your journey in a fun way.
